  - If you get a probem with materialize refer to https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/4193 for the solution. If you go to tamerny/.meteor/packages and just delete the line that says materialize:materialize then your code should compile and run but the platfrom will be functional with no design aspects to it. I'm currently working on a general solution to this.. will update and push once I code it in! 
  - If you get with Moyasar and babel-runtime do the following from your terminal:
    1. meteor install --save moyasar
    2. meteor install --save babel-runtime

= Code should work!
